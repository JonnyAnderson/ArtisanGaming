				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					Most of you know me as "Artisan" or "Rogue Artisan" but my real name is Jonny... I'm an avid gamer and am currently focused on Halo and Minecraft. I try to bring an element of artistry to gaming -- something I think is generally missing from the field. My bio typically reads "build and shoot" -- a nod to my typical gameplay. I am intensely competitive, but also believe there is something inherently admirable in creation.
				</p>

				<br />

				<h4>Gaming Background</h4>
				<p>
					I've been gaming since I was a young kid in the early '90s. I was a huge fan of the original Mario titles and fell in love with a Nintendo game called 1942. However, I don't think I became a true "gamer" until I started playing Goldeneye on the N64.
				</p>
				<p>
					I spent absurd hours playing Goldeneye throughout much of the late 90's. In 2000, my family moved to California. This is when I started gaming on the PC more. I played a few games, but most of my efforts were devoted to a rather obscure online strategy game. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It wasn't until 2010 when I finally made my return to the console world. A couple years earlier, I had played Halo 3 on a roommate's Xbox. I fell in love with the game, but didn't have many opportunities to play. When I finally bought my Xbox 360, Halo 3 was the first game I got. I played as much as I could and started to become pretty decent, although I was still way behind those who had been playing Halo for years.
				</p>
				<p>
					In September of that year, Halo: Reach was released... this is where gaming became more than a hobby, more than a passion, but truly a profession for me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although I was still a relative noob when compared to the more seasoned players of the Halo <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">gaming</span> community, I started to turn some heads. I still wasn't part of the competitive scene, but I became a dominant player in the Living Dead (Infection) playlist. I also started to develop a large following around my Forge maps. I had several maps that ended up being downloaded thousands of times each.
				</p>

				<br />

				<h4>Real Life</h4>
				<p>
					If you've followed me for any amount of time, you probably already know that I despise synicism, sarcasm, and negativity. I was born and raised believing that anyone can accomplish anything. At a young age, I decided I wanted to make a difference in the world and I came to the conclusion that the best way to pull it off was through technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started building websites when I was about 12 years old. I learned html, graphic design, various programming languages like php and java, and eventually started taking college/university courses in computer science, multimedia, and business.
				</p>
